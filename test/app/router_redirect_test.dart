// Unit tests for the splash/auth redirect state machine that drives the app's
// cold-start flow. The logic lives in `resolveSplashRedirect`
// (lib/app/router.dart), extracted from GoRouter's `redirect` callback so the
// three phases can be exercised without assembling a router + widget tree.
//
// The phases:
//   1. Before splash completes — capture the requested URI, force /splash.
//   2. Splash done, unauthenticated — force /login (allowing login/register).
//   3. Splash done, authenticated — replay a captured deep link, otherwise
//      bounce off splash/login/register to home and allow protected routes.
