# iOS Fastlane — TestFlight

A scaffold for building each flavor (`dev` / `staging` / `prod`) and uploading
it to TestFlight. All account-specific values live in `fastlane/.env`, which is
git-ignored, so this template ships with **no secrets and nothing to scrub**
before reuse on a new project.

Signing uses [`match`](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/match/): the
distribution certificate and provisioning profiles are stored (encrypted) in a
private git repo and fetched at build time, so every machine and CI runner
signs identically.

**Prerequisites:** a paid Apple Developer Program membership, and a macOS
machine with Xcode (App Store builds can only be produced on macOS).

## One-time setup

1. **Ruby + bundler.** The repo pins Ruby via `.ruby-version` (3.2.2); install
   it with `rbenv`/`asdf`. `Gemfile.lock` is committed, so:

   ```bash
   cd ios
   bundle install
   ```

2. **App Store Connect API key.** In App Store Connect → *Users and Access →
   Integrations → App Store Connect API*, create a key with *App Manager* (or
   higher) access and download the `AuthKey_XXXX.p8` (you can only download it
   once). Keep the `.p8` outside the repo.

3. **App registration.** Make sure the app exists in App Store Connect for each
   flavor you ship. The lane derives the id from `IOS_BUNDLE_ID_BASE` plus the
   flavor suffix (`.dev`, `.staging`, none for prod).

4. **Configure `.env`.**

   ```bash
   cp fastlane/.env.example fastlane/.env
   # fill in the values; for the API key:
   base64 -i /path/to/AuthKey_XXXX.p8 | pbcopy   # paste as APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_CONTENT
   ```

5. **Initialize match.** Create an empty **private** git repo for the signing
   assets, set `MATCH_GIT_URL` + `MATCH_PASSWORD` in `.env`, then generate the
   cert + profiles once (this populates the repo):

   ```bash
   bundle exec fastlane match appstore
   ```

## Usage

```bash
cd ios
bundle exec fastlane beta flavor:prod      # prod → TestFlight
bundle exec fastlane beta flavor:staging
bundle exec fastlane beta flavor:dev
```

The `beta` lane: fetches signing assets with `match`, compiles with
`flutter build ios --no-codesign --flavor <f> --build-number <n>`, archives +
signs via `build_app` (manual signing with the match profile), uploads dSYMs to
Firebase Crashlytics, then uploads the build to TestFlight.

### Build numbers

TestFlight rejects a duplicate or non-increasing build number. The lane sets it
from, in order: a `build_number:` arg, the `BUILD_NUMBER` env var (CI sets
this), else the git commit count. Pass one explicitly when needed:

```bash
bundle exec fastlane beta flavor:prod build_number:42
```

### QA builds via Firebase App Distribution

```bash
bundle exec fastlane match adhoc          # one-time: create ad-hoc profiles
bundle exec fastlane firebase flavor:dev
```

Builds an **ad-hoc** signed IPA (separate from the App Store profile `beta`/
`release` use — ad-hoc is what lets Firebase install directly on registered
test devices) and pushes it to testers via Firebase App Distribution. Requires
`bundle exec fastlane add_plugin firebase_app_distribution` once (already
declared in `Pluginfile`; run `bundle install` after pulling this) and
`FIREBASE_IOS_APP_ID_<FLAVOR>` set in `.env` per flavor. Register test devices'
UDIDs with Apple first — ad-hoc profiles only install on devices already known
to the profile.

## CI

`.github/workflows/release.yml` runs this lane on a macOS runner (Xcode
required) on tag push / manual dispatch, with `FLUTTER_CMD=flutter` and
`BUILD_NUMBER` from the run number. It expects these repository secrets/vars:

| Name | Kind | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `IOS_BUNDLE_ID_BASE` | var | Base bundle id |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | secret | Developer Team ID |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID` | secret | API key id |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_ISSUER_ID` | secret | API issuer id |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_CONTENT` | secret | base64 of the `.p8` |
| `MATCH_GIT_URL` | secret | Signing-assets repo URL |
| `MATCH_PASSWORD` | secret | match encryption passphrase |
| `MATCH_GIT_BASIC_AUTHORIZATION` | secret | base64 `user:token` for HTTPS clone (omit for SSH) |
| `IOS_GOOGLE_SERVICE_INFO_PLIST` | secret | base64 of `GoogleService-Info.plist` (git-ignored) |

## Troubleshooting (first real run)

The lane is wired but has not been run end-to-end against a real account. Watch
for these on the first release:

- **"No profile for bundle id …" during export** — the lane expects match to
  name profiles `match AppStore <bundle_id>`. If yours differ, fix the
  `provisioningProfiles` map in `build_app`, or re-run
  `bundle exec fastlane match appstore` to (re)create them.
- **match can't access the certs repo on CI** — provide
  `MATCH_GIT_BASIC_AUTHORIZATION` (base64 `user:token`) for HTTPS, or a deploy
  key for SSH.
- **dSYM upload fails / `upload-symbols` not found** — point
  `CRASHLYTICS_UPLOAD_SYMBOLS_BIN` at the binary in your Pods. This step is
  best-effort and won't fail the lane's upload.
- **Xcode/Flutter mismatch on the runner** — the workflow uses `macos-15`; pin a
  specific Xcode version there if the default is incompatible with Flutter 3.44.
- **"Version already used"** — a re-run of the same CI workflow reuses
  `github.run_number`. Pass `build_number:` explicitly or bump the run.
