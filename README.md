```

The repository uses Dart Pub Workspaces. The root package (`lib/`) is the
assembled Flutter app — a thin composition root: routing, DI composition,
optional-feature wiring, and Firebase bootstrap. It owns no feature code.
Every feature lives as a self-contained package under `packages/features/`, and
reusable infrastructure lives in `packages/`, both consumed through package
entry points such as `package:network/network.dart` and
`package:feature_home/feature_home.dart`.

Workspace packages own their third-party implementation details. For example,
the root app depends on `network`, not directly on `dio` or `retrofit`;
`network` exports those APIs when the app needs the types. The same pattern
keeps platform, storage, analytics, theme, and UI dependencies versioned in one
place and avoids root-package dependency conflicts.

Every feature is a `feature_<name>` package under `packages/features/` with its
own `data/domain/presentation` layers and a micro-package DI module
(`Feature<Name>PackageModule`) the app wires at composition time. Data-less
features such as `home` and `splash` ship only a presentation layer. Genuinely
cross-feature contracts live in `shared_contracts` (domain projections and
reader interfaces) and `shared_ui` (the app-wide `Session`/`SessionScope` and
shared widgets), promoted only on the rule of three. A feature may not import
another feature except through a documented single-consumer **capability**
(e.g. `bookmarks` embeds two `collections` widgets, `profile` surfaces `auth`'s
delete-account flow); both rules are enforced by the architecture guardrail
tests under `test/architecture/`. ObjectBox entities and the generated bindings
are centralized in the `database` package, and localization (ARB sources +
gen-l10n) lives in `localization`, shared by the app shell and every feature
package.

All shared UI lives in `packages/app_ui` and is consumed through
`package:app_ui/app_ui.dart`; add new generic widgets there. Package-owned tests
live beside their package in `packages/<name>/test`, while root app tests stay
under `test/`.

The workspace dependency graph is shown as three focused views — a layered
overview, the infrastructure internals, and the feature packages — rather than
one dense diagram. In every view, arrows point from a package **to what it
depends on**.

**1. Layered overview** — the mental model. Dependencies only ever point
downward: `app → features → shared / infra → architecture`.

```mermaid
graph TD
  app["app · lib/ — composition root"]
  features["Feature packages"]
  shared["Shared contracts"]
  infra["Infra & UI packages"]
  architecture["architecture — foundation"]

  app --> features & shared & infra
  features --> shared & infra & architecture
  shared --> architecture
  infra --> architecture
```

**2. Infrastructure & shared contracts** — the inter-package edges within the
lower layers. The leaf packages `config`, `storage`, `app_ui`, and
`localization` have no workspace dependencies (only third-party libs), so they
don't appear here.

```mermaid
graph TD
  shared_ui --> shared_contracts --> architecture
  app_platform --> analytics --> architecture
  theme --> analytics
  app_platform --> architecture
  theme --> architecture
  network --> config
  database --> rev_sync
```

**3. Feature packages** — every feature is a package under `packages/features/`.
The only feature→feature edges are the two documented capabilities: `bookmarks`
reuses two `collections` widgets, and `profile` surfaces `auth`'s delete-account
flow. Infra edges are summarized per feature.

```mermaid
graph TD
  auth["features/auth"]
  splash["features/splash"]
  home["features/home"]
  profile["features/profile"]
  notifications["features/notifications"]
  bookmarks["features/bookmarks"]
  collections["features/collections"]

  profile --> auth
  bookmarks --> collections

  auth --> network & storage & analytics & config
  bookmarks --> network & database & rev_sync & analytics & app_platform
  collections --> network & database & rev_sync
  notifications --> network & database & rev_sync
  home --> shared_contracts
  profile --> analytics & theme
  splash --> shared_ui & app_ui & localization
```

**External dependency encapsulation** — each infrastructure package owns its
third-party libraries so the app (and other packages) depend on the workspace
package, never the raw dependency.

Each box is a workspace package; the libraries inside it are the third-party
dependencies it encapsulates.

```mermaid
graph TB
  subgraph network
    dio
    retrofit
    firebase_performance
  end
  subgraph database
    objectbox
    path_provider
  end
  subgraph app_platform
    camera
    image_picker
    permission_handler
    share_plus
    video_player
    firebase_messaging
    firebase_crashlytics
    flutter_local_notifications
  end
  subgraph app_ui
    google_fonts
    cached_network_image
    photo_view
    carousel_slider
    flutter_slidable
    flutter_animate
  end
  subgraph theme
    flutter_bloc
    flex_color_scheme
  end
  subgraph storage
    flutter_secure_storage
    shared_preferences
  end
  subgraph config
    firebase_remote_config
  end
  subgraph analytics
    firebase_analytics
  end
  subgraph localization
    intl
  end
```

### 📁 Feature Slice (Clean Architecture)

Each feature package keeps its layers under `lib/src/`, with a barrel
(`lib/feature_<name>.dart`) exporting only the public surface (DI module, domain,
screens, capability widgets). Data-less features (`home`, `splash`) ship only
`presentation/`.

```
packages/features/<name>/
├── lib/
│   ├── feature_<name>.dart      Public barrel (DI module, domain, screens)
│   └── src/
│       ├── data/
│       │   ├── datasources/     Remote (Retrofit) + Local (ObjectBox / secure storage)
│       │   ├── models/          Freezed DTOs with toDomain() mappers
│       │   └── repositories/    Concrete implementations
│       ├── domain/
│       │   ├── entities/        Pure Dart classes — zero framework deps
│       │   ├── repositories/    Abstract interfaces
│       │   └── usecases/        Single‑purpose, injectable
│       ├── presentation/
│       │   ├── bloc/            Bloc + freezed state
│       │   └── screens/         Stateless/Stateful widgets
│       ├── di.dart              @InjectableInit.microPackage() anchor
│       └── locator.dart         Shared GetIt instance
└── pubspec.yaml                 name: feature_<name>, resolution: workspace
```

<br>

### 🪄 Scaffolding a New Feature

Rather than hand-create the package above, the project's `fst` CLI scaffolds and
wires a presentation-only feature in one command. Run it from the **repo root**:

```bash
dart pub global activate flutter_starter_template_cli   # one-time — provides `fst`
fst add-feature settings                                # or run bare to be prompted
```

This generates `packages/features/settings/` — a presentation-only slice with a
screen routed at `/settings` — and wires it into every place the app needs to
know about it:

| Wired into | File |
|---|---|
| Workspace member + dependency | `pubspec.yaml` |
| Injectable DI graph | `lib/app/di/injection.dart` |
| `enabledFeatures` registry | `lib/app/features.dart` |

It then runs `pub get` + code generation so the tree compiles immediately. Pass
`--no-codegen` to skip that step and regenerate yourself later.

The wiring edits land at the `# fst:` / `// fst:` markers in those files (so the
generator never has to parse Dart) — leave the markers in place. The `fst` CLI
source lives in [`published/cli/`](published/cli); it's the same tool as the `fst create`
project scaffolder.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 📋 Prerequisites

| Tool    | Version | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Flutter | ≥ 3.44  | Managed via [FVM](https://fvm.app/) — see `.fvmrc` |
| Node.js | ≥ 18    | Optional — only for the `firebase` MCP server (`npx`) |

### ⚡ Install & Generate

> 🧩 **Starting a new project?** Click **Use this template** on GitHub to spin
> up your own repo, then clone it. To explore the template itself, clone
> directly.

```bash
# --recurse-submodules pulls the vendored submodules (published/cli, rev_sync)
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/kido-luci/flutter-starter-template.git
cd flutter-starter-template

# One-shot bootstrap: submodules, FVM SDK, disable SPM (macOS), pub get,
# code generation, and the pre-push hook. Idempotent.
./tool/setup.sh
```

> 💡 **Already cloned without submodules?** `tool/setup.sh` runs
> `git submodule update --init --recursive` for you. Re-run the script anytime
> your tree needs a refresh; pass `--help` to see flags (`--no-codegen`,
> `--no-hooks`).

<details>
<summary><b>⚙️ Prefer to run the steps manually?</b></summary>
<br>

`tool/setup.sh` simply chains these:

```bash
fvm flutter pub get
fvm dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
fvm flutter config --no-enable-swift-package-manager   # macOS only — see below
git config core.hooksPath .githooks                    # enable the pre-push gate
```

</details>

### 🍎 iOS one-time setup

iOS builds must use CocoaPods, **not** Swift Package Manager — Firebase needs an
iOS 15.0 deployment target, but Flutter 3.44.0 hardcodes the SPM-generated
package to 13.0, and two plugins (`permission_handler_apple`,
`objectbox_flutter_libs`) don't support SPM yet. This setting lives in a
machine-global Flutter config (`~/.config/flutter/settings`), so **every new
machine and CI runner must run it once** before the first iOS build.
`tool/setup.sh` already does this on macOS; to run it by hand:

```bash
fvm flutter config --no-enable-swift-package-manager
```

### 📱 Launch App

```bash
fvm flutter run
```

<br>

## 🧪 Testing & Code Quality

This template includes a robust set of automated tests and static analysis configuration to ensure code quality.

### 🏃 Running Tests

Root app tests mirror the `lib/` feature structure. Package-owned tests live
beside the package they cover under `packages/<name>/test`.

```bash
# Run root app unit and widget tests
fvm flutter test --exclude-tags golden

# Run a specific test file
fvm flutter test test/widget_test.dart

# Run tests by name match
fvm flutter test --name "signs in"

# Run a package's own tests
(cd packages/network && fvm flutter test)
```

Shared mocks and test fixtures live in `packages/test_utils` and are exported
through `package:test_utils/test_utils.dart`; root-only fixtures remain in
`test/test_utils/`.

CI runs root tests with coverage, then runs each package test suite with
coverage and merges the LCOV reports before enforcing the workspace coverage
threshold. Golden tests are excluded in CI because baselines are generated on
macOS while CI runs on Ubuntu.

Refer to the [test/README.md](test/README.md) file for detailed testing
guidelines and patterns.

### 🔍 Static Analysis & Linting

Verify lint rules, formatting, and type safety before committing:

```bash
# Analyze code for warnings and errors
fvm flutter analyze

# Automatically apply quick fixes
fvm dart fix --apply

# Format all Dart files
fvm dart format .
```

<br>

## 🔄 Git Workflow & PRs

The `main` branch is protected — all changes land through Pull Requests, with
**CodeRabbit** AI review and **CodeQL** security scanning on every PR.

The full contributor workflow — branch naming, the local verification gate, the
pre-push hook, opening a PR, and the AI review / security tooling — lives in
[**`CONTRIBUTING.md`**](CONTRIBUTING.md).

```bash
# The local gate CI enforces — run before pushing
fvm dart format .
fvm flutter analyze
fvm flutter test --exclude-tags golden
```

<br>

---

<br>

## 🔥 Firebase

Crashlytics + Analytics + Messaging — pre‑configured and ready to connect.

```bash
fvm dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
flutterfire configure                          # → lib/firebase_options.dart
```

Drop these into your project:
- `android/app/google-services.json`
- `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`

The Firebase **platform** (core, remote config, messaging) initializes in
`lib/main.dart` behind the `kFirebaseEnabled` flag in `lib/app/firebase.dart`,
with crash reporting installed through the `CrashReporter` port.

### Optional & swappable

Firebase is opt-out. `fst create --no-firebase` scaffolds a project that builds
and runs with **no Firebase project at all**: it flips `kFirebaseEnabled` to
`false`, swaps the analytics and crash bindings to no-ops, removes the Firebase
Android Gradle plugins, and deletes the native credential files. Re-enable later
by flipping the flag, restoring the bindings, and running `flutterfire configure`.

Analytics and crash reporting are independent **ports** (`AnalyticsService`,
`CrashReporter`), wired in the `analytics` and `app_platform` packages. Each has
a Firebase adapter and a no-op, selected at a single `// fst:analytics-impl` /
`// fst:crash-impl` binding — so you can keep one on Firebase and the other off,
or plug in your own backend, by editing just that line.

<br>

<br>

## 🍦 Flavors & Environment

Three build flavors driven by `--dart-define` with typed runtime config:

| Flavor    | Android App ID                                    | iOS Bundle ID                                |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `dev`     | `com.lucistudio.flutter_starter_template.dev`     | `com.luci-studio.flutterStarterTemplate.dev` |
| `staging` | `com.lucistudio.flutter_starter_template.staging` | `com.luci-studio.flutterStarterTemplate.staging` |
| `prod`    | `com.lucistudio.flutter_starter_template`         | `com.luci-studio.flutterStarterTemplate`     |

```bash
fvm flutter run --flavor dev     --dart-define-from-file=env/dev.json
fvm flutter run --flavor staging --dart-define-from-file=env/staging.json
fvm flutter run --flavor prod    --dart-define-from-file=env/prod.json
```

`EnvConfig` (`packages/config/lib/config.dart`) surfaces API base URL,
Firebase project IDs, and flavor name from `String.fromEnvironment` at startup.

<br>

---

<br>

## 🚀 Release (Fastlane)

iOS → TestFlight and Android → Google Play are automated with [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools),
one flavor‑aware `beta` lane per platform. Every credential is read from a
git‑ignored `.env` (plus `key.properties` on Android), so nothing secret is
committed — fill those in and go.

```bash
cd ios     && bundle exec fastlane beta flavor:prod   # → TestFlight
cd android && bundle exec fastlane beta flavor:prod   # → Google Play
```

- **Signing** — iOS uses [`match`](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/match/)
  (cert + profiles in a private repo); Android uses an upload keystore wired via
  `android/key.properties` (falls back to debug signing when absent, so the
  template still builds out of the box).
- **Build numbers** auto‑increment (lane arg → `BUILD_NUMBER` → git commit
  count) so repeated uploads are never rejected.
- **CI** — [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) runs
  both lanes on **manual dispatch** (Actions → Release; macOS for iOS, Linux for
  Android), restoring the git‑ignored Firebase configs and signing assets from
  repository secrets. To fire releases from a `v*` tag instead, add a
  `push: tags: ['v*']` trigger to that workflow.

Setup steps and the full list of required secrets live in
[`ios/fastlane/README.md`](ios/fastlane/README.md) and
[`android/fastlane/README.md`](android/fastlane/README.md).

## 📶 Offline‑First Sync

Writes commit to the local **ObjectBox** store first and the UI updates
immediately — the network is reconciled in the background, so the app stays
fully usable offline. The sync machinery is a single reusable engine in the
**`rev_sync` package** (`published/rev_sync`); `bookmarks` and `collections` drive it
through a thin per‑feature adapter, and `notifications` is a read‑state variant
that reuses only the scheduler.

The full model — the shared engine, local‑first writes, the scheduler, and
push/pull with revision‑based delta sync, tombstones, and conflict detection —
is documented in
[`packages/features/README.md`](packages/features/README.md#-offlinefirst-sync).

## 🔗 Deep Linking

Universal Links (iOS) + App Links (Android) with a `DeepLinkState` holder that replays deferred links post‑auth.

## 🧩 UI Widgets

Shared app components live in `packages/app_ui` and are exported through
`package:app_ui/app_ui.dart`.

| Widget              | Purpose                                                          |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `AppAdaptiveScaffold` | Responsive navigation shell with bottom bar / rail behavior    |
| `AppAnimatedText`   | Typewriter + fade text animations                                |
| `AppButton`         | Loading state, expand‑to‑fill, leading icon                      |
| `AppCarousel`       | Auto‑play slider with dot indicators                             |
| `AppEmptyView`      | Empty‑state placeholder — icon + message                         |
| `AppErrorView`      | Error state — icon + message + retry                             |
| `AppLinkPreview`    | Rich card — image, title, description                            |
| `AppListDetailPane` | Responsive master/detail layout primitive                        |
| `AppLoading`        | Centered spinner                                                 |
| `AppNetworkImage`   | Cached network image with loading placeholder and error widgets  |
| `AppPhotoView`      | Interactive image viewer with zoom, rotation, and fullscreen gallery |
| `AppScaffold`       | Themed shell — app bar, connectivity banner                      |
| `AppSkeleton`       | Lightweight loading skeleton                                     |
| `AppSlidable`       | Swipe‑to‑reveal actions wrapper for list items                    |
| `AppTextField`      | Label, prefix icon, validation, autofill hints                   |

Feature-specific widgets stay inside their feature slice. For example, bookmark
video playback widgets live under
`packages/features/bookmarks/lib/src/presentation/widgets/` because they are tied
to bookmark attachment behavior.

## 🤖 AI‑Native Workflow

This project is built for AI‑assisted development with **Command Code**, Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and Antigravity.

### 🎯 Command Code — Taste & Plans

Learned project preferences in `.commandcode/taste/` auto‑guide every agent:

| Domain               | Convention                                                  |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Flutter Packages     | Package selection preferences                               |
| Architecture         | Layered architecture, feature‑slice conventions             |
| Backend              | Go + `go-chi` router                                        |
| Flutter Setup        | l10n · light/dark theming · `--dart-define` flavors         |
| Documentation        | Include Command Code alongside other AI tools in rules      |
| Testing              | Extract shared mocks/fakes into reusable test helpers       |

Architectural plans live in `.commandcode/plans/`.

### 🧪 MCP Servers

Project‑scoped MCP servers in `.mcp.json` give agents direct access to:

| Server      | Command                                        | Purpose                                      |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `dart`      | `fvm dart mcp-server`                          | Static analysis, formatting, packages, tests |
| `codegraph` | `codegraph serve --mcp --path <project-root>` | Symbol search, callers/callees, code context |
| `firebase`  | `npx -y firebase-tools@latest mcp`             | Crashlytics, project config, deploy, security rules |

> 💡 **Tip** — If the CodeGraph index is missing or out of sync, build/update it by running:
> ```bash
> codegraph init -i
> ```

## 🔄 Code Generation

```bash
fvm dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs   # one-shot
fvm dart run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs   # incremental
```

Runs Freezed, Retrofit, Injectable, ObjectBox, `go_router_builder`, `flutter_gen`, and `json_serializable`.

### 📦 Generated files are git-ignored (regenerate after clone)

This repo **does not track** most generated output (`*.g.dart`,
`*.freezed.dart`, `*.config.dart`, `*.gen.dart`) — it is `.gitignore`-d and
regenerated on demand. So **after cloning (or after any `pub get`), run
`build_runner` once** before the project will compile:

```bash
fvm dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

Until you do, your IDE/analyzer will show errors for the missing generated
sources. This keeps PR diffs free of generated noise and avoids
generated-file merge conflicts.

**ObjectBox is the one deliberate exception** — `lib/objectbox.g.dart` **and**
`lib/objectbox-model.json` stay version-controlled (the `.gitignore` negates
the binding; the model file matches no glob). Together they hold the stable
entity/property **UIDs** that keep on-device data intact across schema
migrations, so regenerating them from scratch would risk a destructive schema
change. Both are source-of-truth files.

How the pieces stay consistent:

- **CI** ([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)) runs
  `build_runner` before analyze/test (producing the ignored files), and the
  _"Generate code & verify ObjectBox binding is up to date"_ step fails if the
  tracked ObjectBox files drift — i.e. someone changed an `@Entity` without
  committing the regenerated binding.
- **Release lanes** ([`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml))
  run `build_runner` before the Fastlane build, since `flutter build` does not.
- **`.dart_tool/build` is intentionally not cached** in CI/release. Because the
  outputs are git-ignored, a checkout has none; a restored build cache makes
  `build_runner` skip regenerating files it believes already exist (observed
  with `flutter_gen`'s `assets.gen.dart`), producing a broken tree. Each run
  does a correct full build from an empty cache instead.
- **`.gitattributes`** still marks `*.g.dart`/`*.freezed.dart`/etc.
  `linguist-generated=true`, which applies to the tracked ObjectBox binding.

## 🌐 Localization (i18n)

Translations live in the `localization` package — ARB (Application Resource
Bundle) sources under [packages/localization/lib/l10n/](packages/localization/lib/l10n/),
configured by [packages/localization/l10n.yaml](packages/localization/l10n.yaml).
English and Vietnamese ship out of the box.

### 🛠 Generating Translations

The gen-l10n output is generated alongside the ARB sources in the
`localization` package:

```bash
# Generate localization resources manually
(cd packages/localization && fvm flutter gen-l10n)
```

Import `package:localization/localization.dart` and use
`AppLocalizations.of(context)` (or the `context.l10n` extension) to access
localized strings. The package is shared by the app shell and every feature
package.
