# Environment Configuration (`env/`)

This directory contains JSON files used to define environment variables for different flavors of the application (e.g., development, staging, and production). 

These configuration files are injected into the Flutter application at compile/run time using the `--dart-define-from-file` flag.

## Files

- `dev.json`: Environment variables for the **development** flavor.
- `staging.json`: Environment variables for the **staging** flavor.
- `prod.json`: Environment variables for the **production** flavor.

## Keys

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FLAVOR` | string | One of `dev`, `staging`, `prod`. Backs `EnvConfig.isDev/isStaging/isProd`. |
| `API_BASE_URL` | string | Base URL for the HTTP client. Defaults to the production API (`https://api.zenpack.vn`) when no env file is passed — see `kApiBaseUrl` in `packages/ec_data/lib/src/ec_env.dart`. |
| `API_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | int | Connect/receive timeout for Dio, in seconds. Defaults to 10 if omitted. |
| `REVENUECAT_IOS_KEY` | string | RevenueCat **public** SDK key (`appl_…`). **`prod.json` only** — see below. |
| `REVENUECAT_ANDROID_KEY` | string | Same for Android (`goog_…`). Not set yet — RevenueCat has no Play Store app. |

### Why the RevenueCat keys are only in `prod.json`

These are *public* keys — they ship inside the binary by design, so committing
them here is not a leak (the admin `sk_…` key is a different thing and must
never come near this directory).

They are absent from `dev.json` / `staging.json` **on purpose**. Those flavors
build bundle ids `com.aktechvn.zenpack.dev` / `.staging`, which are not the
bundle registered in App Store Connect or RevenueCat (`com.aktechvn.zenpack`).
With a key present, the SDK would configure, the paywall would open, and
StoreKit would return **zero products** — a blank paywall. With the key absent,
`EcPurchases.configure` exits quietly, `isAvailable` stays false, and the Quota
screen hides the upgrade button entirely. An absent button beats a broken one.

Testing purchases therefore needs a **prod-flavor** build (TestFlight or a
locally prod-signed run) plus a sandbox tester account.

## Usage

When running or building the app, specify the target environment file.

**Using Flutter CLI:**
```bash
fvm flutter run --dart-define-from-file=env/dev.json
fvm flutter build apk --dart-define-from-file=env/prod.json
```

**Using VS Code:**
The `.vscode/launch.json` file is already configured to use these environments. Simply select "Dev (Debug)", "Staging (Debug)", or "Prod (Release)" from the Run/Debug panel in VS Code.

## Reading Values in Dart

Inside the application, these variables are mapped to strongly-typed properties through the `EnvConfig` class using `String.fromEnvironment`. 

```dart
// Example of how it's defined in packages/config/lib/src/env_config.dart
String get apiBaseUrl => const String.fromEnvironment(
  'API_BASE_URL', 
  defaultValue: 'http://localhost:8080'
);
```

You can access these values anywhere in the application by injecting or locating `EnvConfig`:
```dart
final baseUrl = getIt<EnvConfig>().apiBaseUrl;
```

## Firebase Configuration Note

In this project, Firebase configuration is intentionally **not** managed within these `env/*.json` files. 

Instead, Firebase is configured natively via the FlutterFire CLI, which generates the `lib/firebase_options.dart` file and the native iOS/Android config files automatically. If you need to manage multiple Firebase environments, you should use the FlutterFire CLI to generate flavor-specific options files and switch them programmatically in `main.dart`.
